Breathless stories have extolled the benefits of having all these tech-savvy, &quot;new economy&quot; companies move into a stretch of real estate that's been withering legitimate businesses for decades.  It certainly seemed like a good opportunity to take a look at some of the businesses that have thrived in this neighborhood.  Mid-Market and the Tenderloin are home to a thriving ecosystem of micro industries, and these entrepreneurs are in it for the long haul.  Corner for stolen goods&quot;Fenced goods dealers are all at the southwest corner of Market and Seventh,&quot; Deleano Seymour told me as we walked around the neighborhood.  The northeast corner of Market is pretty quiet, but farther down the block, between Seventh and Sixth, there's another, larger, group of young gentlemen who are usually there.  Just weed, stolen goods, and then the women who sell food stamps and USDA commodities.  Dealers commute on BARTSeymour has been mentioned in the pages of this newspaper as the guide for Tenderloin Walking Tours, an excellent tour he leads by appointment.  Like many people who once lived on the wrong side of the law, Seymour has embraced the straight life with passion - moving to Nob Hill, wearing suits and hats no matter the occasion, offering reactionary opinions on illegal activity.  &quot;Right now I'd say prescription drugs are the top seller on the street,&quot; he said.  &quot;Prescription drug sellers are all about volume - they can make two or three thousand dollars a month selling their meds,&quot; he said as we walked through, watching them do just that.

Vaslav Nijinsky, the great Russian dancer who was driven from the stage by madness in 1917 at the peak of his fame, recorded his thoughts and ravings in the next two years in a diary that he signed ''God Nijinsky.''   Although the diary was published in 1946 while Nijinsky was still alive, and the original handwritten volumes were sold at auction in 1979 for more than $100,000, a long-suppressed preface by the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler has now been printed for the first time, in The Archives of General Psychiatry.   The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority. She replaced the preface with one of her own, which glorified her husband.

A large national gathering of Christian evangelicals, including hundreds of television and radio broadcasters, was urged today to bolster the campaign by evangelical political activists to combat secular humanism, which was described as ''the established religion of America.''   The challenge was delivered by the Rev. D. James Kennedy, the pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a leading figure in the recent drive by conservative church groups to help elect candidates who espoused views that agreed with fundamentalist moral principles.   Mr. Kennedy also serves on the board of the Round Table, an umbrella group for religiously conservative activists.  He told 2,000 delegates at a joint meeting of National Religious Broadcasters and the National Association of Evangelicals that evangelicals should increase their level of political involvement because ''secular humanists have declared war on Christianity in this country and they are progressing very rapidly.''

After hours of concern over predicted weather conditions at the landing site, officials of the space agency decided today not to order the space shuttle Columbia back to earth a day early but to proceed with plans for a landing Monday as scheduled.   The seven-day test flight of the re-usable winged spaceship is now set to end at 2:27 P.M. Eastern standard time on a desert landing strip at the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico.   By going the full duration, the astronauts, Col. Jack R. Lousma of the Marine Corps and Col. C. Gordon Fullerton of the Air Force, will have circumnavigated the earth 115 times, logging 3.4 million miles since their launching last Monday. Improved Weather Forecast   The decision to adhere to the original flight plan was announced early this afternoon on the basis of new weather reports indicating that the clouds and gusty winds at White Sands should move out of the area by Monday. The forecast is for high-altitude clouds, light breezy winds and only occasional gusts.
